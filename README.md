# Local Weather App

*__Note__: To look at a newly-built full-stack Todo List project using React, Redux, ExpressJS and MongoDB, please click [here](https://github.com/hongkuancn/todo-list).*

This is a frontend project from freeCodeCamp which can show your local weather.

I built a simple server for it, and pushed it to Heroku.

You can change the unit of temperature with a simple click.

Remember to allow your website to use your current location.
